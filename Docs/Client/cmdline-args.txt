Infantry.exe Command Line Arguments
Super-Man

Found some stuff after snooping around Infantry.exe, documented it as well as I could have. Still missing a couple notes.
/ticket:[] Obviously we've been using this one already. If you don't provide a ticket, you're alerted to restart the client via the launcher
/quick No idea what this one is trying to do, I see no behavioral changes in infantry.exe, but I could be missing something. Somebody find out!
/name:[] This has no effect on how the infantry.exe client reacts but it was used in SOE Infantrys launcher to identify your account name
/launch:[] Skips loading the client/zonelist interface and goes directly into loading a zone specified in "ip:port" format
/dirserve:[] Writes the specified dirserver to registry and replaces old one, refreshes zone list with new dirserver.
/alias:[] Launches client with specified alias
/upgrade From what I can tell in the debugger, it's attempting to create a new process (infup.exe). This was probably the old method of upgrading the infantry.exe client before a launcher was introduced, obsolete now
/uid:[] Doesn't effect client behavior, probably a pre-launcher user identifier, most likely useless
/delete:[] Deletes a specified file (ex: /delete "vehicle.blo") in current directory

Cool uses:
infantry.exe /ticket:"whatever" /alias:"My Alias!" /launch:"192.168.1.1:1337"
This will put you right into whatever zone is hosted at 192.168.1.1:1337, assuming your ticket is valid and there are no issues with your username.
The client zonelist interface won't be loaded and skipped entirely, and when you exit the zone, the client closes as well.
This could make creating a new zonelist interface an extremely easy task if we ever wanted to do such a thing instead of going through the hassle of 
hacking up infantry.exe, or if skinning the current client by modifying its bitmaps just isn't enough for us. Anyways, this is all speculation.
