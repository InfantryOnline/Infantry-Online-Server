	/// The rows of the 3x3 R matrix are the basis vectors of the space.  They are
	/// all constrained to be mutually perpendicular and of unit length.  The top
	/// ("x") row is called "side", the middle ("y") row is called "up" and the
	/// bottom ("z") row is called forward.  The translation vector is called
	/// "position".  Finally the "homogeneous column" is always [0 0 0 1].
