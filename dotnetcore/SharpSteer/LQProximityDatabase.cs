	This utility is a spatial database which stores objects each of
	which is associated with a 3d point (a location in a 3d space).
	The Points serve as the "search key" for the associated object.
	It is intended to efficiently answer "sphere inclusion" queries,
	also known as range queries: basically questions like:

		Which objects are within a radius R of the location L?

	In this context, "efficiently" means significantly faster than the
	naive, brute force O(n) testing of all known Points.  Additionally
	it is assumed that the objects move along unpredictable paths, so
	that extensive preprocessing (for example, constructing a Delaunay
	triangulation of the point set) may not be practical.

	The implementation is a "bin lattice": a 3d rectangular array of
	brick-shaped (rectangular parallelepipeds) regions of space.  Each
	region is represented by a pointer to a (possibly empty) doubly-
	linked list of objects.  All of these sub-bricks are the same
	size.  All bricks are aligned with the global coordinate axes.

	Terminology used here: the region of space associated with a bin
	is called a sub-brick.  The collection of all sub-bricks is called
	the super-brick.  The super-brick should be specified to surround
	the region of space in which (almost) all the key-Points will
	exist.  If key-Points move outside the super-brick everything will
	continue to work, but without the speed advantage provided by the
	spatial subdivision.  For more details about how to specify the
	super-brick's position, size and subdivisions see lqCreateDatabase
	below.

	Overview of usage: an application using this facility would first
	create a database with lqCreateDatabase.  For each client object
	the application wants to put in the database it creates a
	lqClientProxy and initializes it with lqInitClientProxy.  When a
	client object moves, the application calls lqUpdateForNewLocation.
	To perform a query lqMapOverAllObjectsInLocality is passed an
	application-supplied call-back function to be applied to all
	client objects in the locality.  See lqCallBackFunction below for
	more detail.  The lqFindNearestNeighborWithinRadius function can
	be used to find a single nearest neighbor using the database.

	Note that "locality query" is also known as neighborhood query,
	neighborhood search, near neighbor search, and range query.  For
	additional information on this and related topics see:
	http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/ips.html

	For some description and illustrations of this database in use,
	see this paper: http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/2000/pip.html
